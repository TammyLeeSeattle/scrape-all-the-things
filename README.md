# scrape-all-the-things
Week 18 University of Washington Programming Bootcamp Homework

[TODO: INSERT DESCRIPTION]


## Homework Instructions
In this assignment, you'll create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

## How to access it
This application is hosted in Heroku! The front-end experience can be found here: [TODO: INSERT](TODO: INSERT)... and no, I didn't pick the domain name. 

If you'd like to see the action behind the scenes, check out the github repo: [https://github.com/TammyLeeSeattle/scrape-all-the-things.git](https://github.com/TammyLeeSeattle/scrape-all-the-things.git).
